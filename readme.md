DHCP XML parser and REST service.

It uses a Powershell script to fetch the DHCP data from a DHCP server and writes it to a XML file, which script.py 
parses and creates a array of Lease dict objects, added Flask to send this data to a front-end application I am building
on the side, which is basicly a admin console that I use at work. I'll upload a simple front-end later.

I'll update this later, heading home right now.
